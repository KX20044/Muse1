      Hi, I'm Janine, Founder of Muse and Head of Neuroplasticity at Old Creeks Research Facility for the past 14 years! Having a long career in neuroplasticity has given me the necessary background to consider how I can change lives in my older patients. After going into research into the many unrecorded cases of elder abuse, and the overwhelmingly understaffed facilities that house many of our older residents, I developed Muse over several years, investing much time and labour, alongside my excellent team, to see how we could contribute safely to the lives of those in prime years and reinvigorate joy back into them. It's been a long time since first starting this journey and we're so excited that you've come along!

    <h4>Why We Created Muse</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: left; padding-left: 2%; padding-right: 2%;">
Muse was created to relieve some of the strain on the healthcare-tech system and build genuine, fulfilling and emotional relationships for those living alone in the latter stages of life. Continuing low birth rates, a growing ageing population and growing reports of elder abuse and neglect prompted our lovely founders Janine and Cass to consider other alternatives of aged care and ultimately transform the sector. Now, with over 11.2 million units active, we couldn't be prouder of how far we've come.
